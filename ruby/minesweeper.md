# Phase 1

``` ruby
def build_field(dimension, number_of_mines
end
```

# Phase 2

Optional phase for more advanced level

``` ruby
def count_mines(x,y, field)
end
```

# Phase 3


``` ruby
def reveal(x,y)
end

module UI
  def open(x,y, number)
  end
  def win_game
  end
  def lose_game
  end
end
```
